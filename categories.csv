The main goal of the forward proxy is to provide a level of security and also to reduce network traffic.,"A proxy is a middle man between the user and the destination website.A forward proxy helps us communicate with the internet securely, this is only for internal to external traffic. For example when someone inside the network is browsing the internet all the traffic is going through the forward proxy. This is to make sure users don't go to malicious sites or sites that a company does not want users to go to. A forward proxy is typically used in alongside a firewall to enhance an internal network's security by controlling traffic originating from clients in the internal network that are directed at hosts on the Internet. Thus, from a security standpoint, a forward proxy is primarily aimed at enforcing security on client computers in your internal network. If the site is bad proxies can block and report this.

WAF,"A web application firewall (WAF) protects web application servers and infrastructure from attacks and breaches originating from the Internet and external networks. Some threats that a WAF provides protection against are SQL injection, XML injection and DDoS attacks.","Provides protection and visibility into a wide range of attack vectors that can exist on a web application (App that runs on a web server i.e. banking app, web mail, retail, information/marketing). This is a IDS/IPS (See IDS/IPS def above) specific for Web Applications. There are special attacks targeted at only web servers, and this tool detects those (See types of threat visibility for attacks).",Akamai Kona Site Defender Amazon WAF Barracuda WAF CloudFlare WAF F5 Networks ASM Imperva Incapsula Imperva SecureSphere Signal Science Shape Trustwave WAF,"Web attacks (SQL Injection, Directory Traversal, Brute force, command injection), IDS Web Shell attacks, Allowed Exploits from Threat IP.https://www.pentasecurity.com/blog/top-7-common-types-cyberattacks-web-applications/"
Web Server,"A web server is a system that delivers content or services to end users over the internet.

WIDS/WIPS,A wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS) is a dedicated security device or integrated software application that monitors a wireless LAN network's for rogue access points and other wireless threats.,"In computing, a wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS) is a network device that monitors the radio spectrum for the presence of unauthorized access points (intrusion detection), and can automatically take countermeasures (intrusion prevention). Basically an IDS/IPS for Wireless.  If the device has protection capabilities it can block and alert. It can detect evil twin networks (Wireless Access Points with the same name to trick devices). The Access Point would handle authentication, WIDS/WIPS handles misuse.",Cisco Meraki Extreme Networks AirDefense,"If an employee (trusted entity) in a location brings in an easily available wireless router (Rouge access point), the entire network can be exposed to anyone within range of the signals.  WIDS/WIPS detects this. It can also detect attempts to gain unauthorized access to the wireless or evil twin access points."
Wireless Infrastructure,"Wireless infrastructure includes wireless access points and wireless controllers.  A wireless controller manages wireless network access points that allow wireless devices to connect to the network. A wireless access point (WAP) is a hardware device or configured node on a local area network (LAN) that allows wireless capable devices and wired networks to connect through a wireless standard, including Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.",Devices can gain access to the network through Wireless APs at the company headquarters. This has no visibility into home or external wireless. A wireless controller manages wireless network access points that allow wireless devices to connect to the network.,,Logging this device would provide visibility into additional types of authentication or specific wireless attacks.
